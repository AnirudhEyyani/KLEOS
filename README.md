## RAIT ACM KLEOS NATIONAL LEVEL HACKATHON 

<b>ABOUT RAIT ACM STUDENT CHAPTER</b>

<P>

Established on August 26, 2019, the RAIT ACM Student Chapter. We received an incredible reaction from our university as the First ACM Student Chapter in Navi Mumbai, and 105 students signed up for the international membership in the first month alone. The next year, we had more than 500 active members. Our chapter's mission is to bring together and educate students in the fields of management, programming, problem-solving, and creative thinking. Through the many events we run, interpersonal skills including teamwork and communication skills are also fostered.

<b>OBJECTIVES</b> 

Kleos is a platform for all those talented professionals, developers, engineers, data scientists, project managers and dev ops technologists to compete over 36 hours to find creative solutions to solve tough and real world problems related to focusing on performance.

The hackathon inspires developers to keep their focus aside from pure functionality and bring in innovativeness to the concept. It is centred on six tracks as mentioned below:
- Environment
- Education
- Finance
- Rural Development
- Entertainment
- HealthCare
